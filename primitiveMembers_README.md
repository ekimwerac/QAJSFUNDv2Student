In JavaScript, primitive types themselves (such as numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, and symbols) don't have member methods or properties. However, when you use a primitive value in a method or property expression, JavaScript automatically converts the primitive value to its corresponding wrapper object, allowing you to access methods and properties associated with that wrapper.

For example:

1. **String Methods:**
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello";
   console.log(str.length);  // Accessing the 'length' property
   console.log(str.toUpperCase());  // Calling the 'toUpperCase' method
   ```

   In this case, when you access `length` or call `toUpperCase()` on `str`, JavaScript temporarily converts `str` to a `String` object.

2. **Number Methods:**
   ```javascript
   let num = 42;
   console.log(num.toFixed(2));  // Calling the 'toFixed' method
   ```

   Similarly, when you call `toFixed()` on `num`, JavaScript converts `num` to a `Number` object.

3. **Boolean Methods:**
   ```javascript
   let bool = true;
   console.log(bool.toString());  // Calling the 'toString' method
   ```

   Here, calling `toString()` on `bool` involves a temporary conversion to a `Boolean` object.

4. **Symbol Methods:**
   ```javascript
   let sym = Symbol("mySymbol");
   console.log(sym.description);  // Accessing the 'description' property
   ```

   The `description` property is a property of the `Symbol` wrapper.

While it may seem like primitive types have methods and properties, it's important to understand that JavaScript implicitly wraps primitives in objects when necessary, allowing you to use methods and properties associated with their corresponding wrapper objects. This behavior is known as autoboxing. Once the operation is complete, the temporary wrapper object is discarded.
