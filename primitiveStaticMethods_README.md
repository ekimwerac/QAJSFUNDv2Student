In JavaScript, primitive types like integers don't have static member functions because primitive types themselves are not objects, and static member functions are typically associated with classes or constructor functions.

However, JavaScript has wrapper objects for primitive types, like `Number` for integers, `String` for strings, and `Boolean` for booleans. These wrapper objects have static methods, but they are not directly associated with the primitive types.

For example, with `Number`, you can use static methods like `Number.isInteger()`, `Number.parseFloat()`, and `Number.parseInt()`. These methods are not called on an instance of a number, but rather on the `Number` object itself.

Here's an example:

```javascript
let num = 42;

// Using Number.isInteger() static method
if (Number.isInteger(num)) {
  console.log(`${num} is an integer`);
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is not an integer`);
}
```

In this example, `Number.isInteger()` is a static method that checks if the provided value is an integer.

Similarly, `String` has static methods like `String.fromCharCode()` and `String.fromCodePoint()`, and `Boolean` has static methods like `Boolean()`, which can be used to convert values to booleans.

```javascript
let str = String.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67);
console.log(str); // Outputs: "ABC"

let bool = Boolean("Hello");
console.log(bool); // Outputs: true
```

So, while primitive types themselves don't have static member functions, you can use the corresponding wrapper objects to access static methods associated with those types.
